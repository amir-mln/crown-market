# Crown Market â™¥

This project is the master project of the following udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/

It's been almost a year since i stopped working on it. Back then i did not make a repo on github for it since i did not have any github account. 

The project isn't 100% finished and is far away from being responsive and i'm not plannig to do something about it.
